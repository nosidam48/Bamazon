# Bamazon
A search app for items including customer, manager and supervisor functionality

### The customer app allows the user to purchase a certain amount of a product. The app then displays the total cost and updates the stock quantity in the database

### The manager app offers four options: View inventory, view low inventory, add to inventory and add new product. 

#### View returns all products, low inventory returns those products with less than 20 left in stock, add to inventory allows the manager to pick a product and an amount and updates the new stock amount to the database, add new product allows the manager to add a product and save the results to the database.

#### Here is a screenshot of the table in the database. The stock-quantity amount will change based on customer purchases and manager inventory adds. The total sales number will be added based on the total cost of each customer purchase of that item. A new row will be added if the manager adds a new product.
